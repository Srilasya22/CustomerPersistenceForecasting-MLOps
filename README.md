# Customer Persistence Foreccasting Using MLOps

Customer persistence forecasting is like predicting whether the customer will churn or not so that advanced machine learning techniques and MLOps strategies can be used to retain the customers.Dive into customer data and develop personalized retention plans that keep everyone happy and coming back for seconds!

## About the project

Discovering the secret sauce to keep customers coming back for more! Unleash the power of machine learning and MLOps practices to understand how customers behave, so we can craft irresistible strategies that make them stick around. 


Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Development of predictive models for customer persistence.
- Integrating MLOps principles for efficient model deployment
